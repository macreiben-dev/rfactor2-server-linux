# rfactor2-server-linux

This is docker container that bootstraps a rFactor 2 container on an ubuntu.

## Building the image

- Run any src/build_ script to initialize a server.

# Thoughts

## "Why on earth did you use PowerShell ??"

I originally wrote some scripts to create and manage rF2 server instance. So I took the shortest road to have the server image working.

Second, I don't like bash. Its syntax is esoteric compared to powershell.

Third, this project is a hobby. Take a deep breath and run docker build ;).
